# FusionCast# 🚀 FusionCast — Intelligent Demand Forecasting Platform

FusionCast is an advanced demand forecasting web application built using **Next.js** that integrates deep learning-based forecasting models to enhance prediction accuracy and interpretability.  
It aims to improve upon the original **MCDFN (Multi-Channel Deep Forecasting Network)** model by fusing multiple data sources and applying advanced neural architectures for smarter, adaptive demand forecasting.

---

## 🧠 Project Description

The goal of **FusionCast** is to revolutionize how businesses forecast demand by combining **data-driven modeling**, **AI-powered predictions**, and **interactive visualizations**.  
Traditional models often fail to capture complex, multi-factor relationships influencing demand — FusionCast bridges that gap through advanced model fusion and explainable insights.

### Key Features
- 📊 Multi-source data integration (sales, inventory, pricing, promotions, weather, etc.)  
- 🧠 Deep learning-based forecasting with cross-channel fusion  
- 🧩 Modular architecture supporting future AI model upgrades (TFT, LSTM, LightGBM hybrids)  
- 🌐 Interactive Next.js interface for real-time charting and analysis  
- 📈 Comparison of forecast accuracy between FusionCast and MCDFN

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
The architecture of FusionCast is currently **under design** and will evolve iteratively.
The preliminary design focuses on:
- **Data Preprocessing Layer** — Normalizes and aligns multi-source data.  
- **Feature Extraction Channels** — Dedicated encoders (CNN/GRU/Transformer) for each input stream.  
- **Fusion Layer** — Combines learned embeddings across channels to model correlations. 
- **Forecasting Head** — Generates multi-step time series predictions.  
- **Evaluation Module** — Compares results with baselines like MCDFN and classical models.

### 🔧 Future enhancements may include integration with Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) for improved interpretability and attention-based feature weighting.

## 🔁 SDLC Methodology — Agile
FusionCast is developed using the Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) approach.
This methodology supports continuous improvement and rapid iteration throughout the project lifecycle.

### 🌀 Agile Workflow:

- **Planning** — Define project goals, features, and datasets.  
- **Design** — Develop UI wireframes, system flow diagrams, and architecture drafts.  
- **Development** — Implement backend APIs, frontend components, and model training scripts. 
- **Testing** — Sprint reviews, retrospectives, and backlog updates. 
- **Review & Feedback** — Compares results with baselines like MCDFN and classical models.
- **Deployment"** - Deploy to staging and production environments with CI/CD pipelines.
